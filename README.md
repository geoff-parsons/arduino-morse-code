This is a really basic Arduino script for blinking out messages in morse code.


Usage
=====

Really there's nothing to it. Simply open it in the Arduino editor and put in your desired message in the call to blink in the loop method. If desired you can change the [unit length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#Representation_and_timing) by editing the length global. That's about it.
